# Project 1: The Scanner

The option that I have opted with was the third option, I wanted to aim for the FSA table.

The FSA table is located in `scanner.c` and it is being represented by the `scanner()` variable.

The driver function that is representing the FSA table is located in `testScanner.c` and is being represented by `main()`.
