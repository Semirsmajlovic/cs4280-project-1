# Project 1: The Scanner

The option that I have opted with was the third option, I wanted to aim for the FSA table.
The FSA table is located in `scanner.cpp` and it is being represented by the `scanner()`.
The driver function that is representing the FSA table is located in `testScanner.cpp` and is being represented by `testScanner`.

How to execute the project:
1. Run either of the following commands: `make` or `make scanner`.
2. I have included the `temp.sp2022` and `testFile.sp2022` files with some identifiers to be used.
3. Run the either of the following executions: `./scanner temp` or `./scanner < testFile.sp2022` - You can pass in your own files, but we have options for direct file that appends an extension or input file using stdin.
4. Running `./scanner temp {additional argument}` will trigger an error.
